1.	Install the latest version of java.  This is written on Apr 6, 2024, and I went to:
	https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
	From there, I clicked on "Windows" and went to:
	https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk22-windows
	Then I downloaded the .exe installer (x64 installer)
	
	I also uninstalled all other versions of Java under add/remove programs.
	
2.	Make a note of where you installed my program.  If it's just in C:/Program Files,
	you don't need to do anything with this information.  Otherwise, carefully open the .bat file (FOR EDITING)
	that is in RunDir and replace the string %ProgramW6432% with wherever you installed it (E.g., D:\My Programs).
	Be sure to keep the quotation marks.

3.	Copy the RunDir folder to wherever you wish to run the program.
	You can double-click the .bat file and you will be using the "FlashCardsGame"
	Vietnamese.A.  This is a reference to the folder Vietnamese.A found in
	RunDir\Games.  This folder contains the file Vietnamese.A.properties.

4.	You can text-edit the file Vietnamese.A.properties to tweak the program.
	The most important lines are:
	Cards.File=
	Sound.Files.Dir=
	These refer to where to find the Cards and sound files, and those are
	relative to either the GameFile's directory or the directories
	RunDir/cardsFiles and RunDir/soundFiles.

5.	Other properties that you can edit are:
	a.	Top.Card.Index: Change this if you want to start somewhere other than the beginning.
		This line gets changed by the program as you progress down the file, so if you want to
		start over, you should reset this line to 0.
	b.	Be.Silent: Change this to true if you want to play this without sound.

6.	There are other properties, but they're a little technical and you don't need to change them
	right now.
